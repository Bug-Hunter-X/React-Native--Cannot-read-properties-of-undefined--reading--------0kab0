The solution involves ensuring that the component's state is properly initialized and that any dependent data is available before attempting to access it.  This can be achieved using asynchronous operations (like `useEffect` hook with an asynchronous function) to fetch the data and update the state only after data is ready.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates this approach.
